"""  
This script is a console-based application that translates text and converts it to speech.  

Features:  
- No GUI (pure console-based)  
- Fast and lightweight  
- Automatically deletes the generated MP3 file after playback for clean execution  
- Utilizes the best translation service (deep-translator) and speech synthesis (gtts)  

Requirements:  
- Python 3.x  
- Dependencies: gtts, deep-translator  

Instructions:  
1. Run the script in a console/terminal.  
2. Enter the text you wish to translate when prompted.  
3. Enter the target language code (e.g., 'es' for Spanish).  
4. The script will display the translated text.  
5. Press Enter after listening to the speech to delete the MP3 file.  

Note:  
- The script uses `os.system` to play the MP3 file, which is intended for Windows. Adjust the command for other operating systems as needed (e.g., `afplay` for macOS or `mpg123` for Linux).
